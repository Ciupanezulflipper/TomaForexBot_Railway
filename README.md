 ## ðŸš€ Getting Started
 
 1. **Clone the repo and install dependencies**
 
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TomaForexBot.git
 cd TomaForexBot
 pip install -r requirements.txt
+```
+
+## ðŸ§ª Running Tests
+
+Install dependencies before running tests:
+
+```bash
+pip install -r requirements.txt
+```
+
+If Finnhub tests run without monkeypatching API calls, set the
+`FINNHUB_API_KEY` environment variable. Network connectivity is required unless
+requests are mocked.
+
+Optional packages (for example `MetaTrader5`) may not be available in some
+environments such as CI. The project does not rely on `MetaTrader5` because
+there is no free API, so related tests should be disabled or mocked if the
+package is missing.
